    "\n",
    "Knowing the best case isn't that useful, because it doesn't happen very often, and it's not safe to rely on it. A better approach is to look at the **average case**, for a typical situation. For the average case above (assuming the element is in the list) we'll have to look at half of the elements before we find it. We generally care about the average case, because we'll be running our algorithm many times and the average performance matters.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Second, the worst-case scenario, though rare on random data, might be common on real-world situations. [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm) (on the common sorting algorithms) is $\\mathcal O(n \\log n)$ complexity on average but $\\mathcal O(n^2)$ in the worst case. That might seem ok, except the worst case occurs when the list is already sorted â€“ a fairly common situation. To avoid this it's common to shuffle the list before sorting; or randomely pick the pivot (i.e., not start from either left- or right-most item in the array)."
